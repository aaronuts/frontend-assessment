Folder Exercise1 for Exercise 1 and Exercise2 for Exercise 2


Exercise 1
Please open index.html to see the results. All pictures are under Images folder and css file is on the same folder.


Exercise 2

index.html contains all html code.

func.js include two functions:
1. tabControl();
To detect user click on which button and how related data based on fake href.
2. insertContent();
Read json file and rewrite html file.

I also set a timer with a small delay to run 
it only once when the resizing ends.


All UI designs are under style.css




* Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.

Answer:+'a' resolves to NaN ("Not a Number") because it coerces a string to a number, while the character a cannot be parsed as a number.
